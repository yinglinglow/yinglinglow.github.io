Been working on this cheatsheet! Personally I find it helpful… lolBecause I didn’t quite learn matplotlib before getting into pandas, so it was really confusing for me to be frank.Really recommend beginners to get through matplotlib first, before getting into seaborn and pandas!https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/tree/master/Beginner%20Python%20Cheatsheet—In other news, helping out with Datakind for a dashboard. Hope I can put my skills to good use and help!
